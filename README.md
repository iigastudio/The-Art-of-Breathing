## * Buteyko Breathing *

The Buteyko breathing method is a breathing technique developed by Dr. Konstantin Buteyko in the 1950s. It focuses on reducing the amount of breathing to improve overall health and well-being. The method is based on the principle that many health conditions, such as asthma, anxiety, and high blood pressure, are caused or worsened by chronic hyperventilation, which is excessive and shallow breathing. By practicing Buteyko breathing exercises, individuals learn to regulate their breathing, slow down their breath rate, and increase carbon dioxide levels in the body. This can have numerous benefits, including better oxygenation of tissues, reduced symptoms of respiratory conditions, improved relaxation, and enhanced overall respiratory and cardiovascular function.
